## Features

### Network Scanning

#### How It Works
1. Click "Scan Networks" to initiate discovery
2. Application simulates network detection process
3. Results populate in real-time
4. Scan completes with summary information

#### Scan Results Include
- **SSID**: Network name/identifier
- **MAC Address**: Hardware address (privacy-masked)
- **Signal Strength**: RSSI value in dBm
- **Channel**: WiFi channel number
- **Frequency**: Operating frequency in MHz
- **Encryption**: Security protocol type
- **Vendor**: Equipment manufacturer
- **Last Seen**: Detection timestamp

### Signal Strength Analysis

#### Signal Meter Visualization
- **4-Bar Display**: Visual signal strength indicator
- **Color Coding**:
  - Green: Excellent (-50 dBm or higher)
  - Blue: Good (-50 to -60 dBm)
  - Yellow: Fair (-60 to -70 dBm)
  - Red: Poor (below -70 dBm)

#### Signal Quality Percentage
- Calculated from RSSI values
- Range: 0-100%
- Formula: (RSSI + 100) √ó 2

### Data Export

#### CSV Export
- **Use Case**: Spreadsheet analysis, reporting
- **Contains**: All network data in tabular format
- **Filename**: `wifi-scan-YYYY-MM-DD.csv`

#### JSON Export
- **Use Case**: Developer integration, data processing
- **Contains**: Structured data with metadata
- **Includes**: Scan timestamp and network count
- **Filename**: `wifi-scan-YYYY-MM-DD.json`

### Theme Support

#### Light Mode
- Clean, bright interface
- Optimal for daylight use
- High contrast text

#### Dark Mode
- Reduced eye strain

- System-level access
- Native applications

### Privacy & Security
- **MAC Address Masking**: Only first 2 and last 2 octets shown
- **No Personal Data**: No user information collected
- **Local Processing**: All filtering/sorting done in browser

### Performance
- **Scan Duration**: 1-3 seconds (simulated)
- **Network Limit**: Optimized for 50+ networks
- **Browser Memory**: Minimal impact on system resources

### API Endpoints
- `GET /api/scan`: Retrieve network list
- `GET /api/details/:ssid`: Get specific network info
- `GET /api/health`: Service status check

## FAQ

### General Questions

**Q: Is this real WiFi scanning?**
A: No, this application uses simulated data for demonstration. Real WiFi scanning requires specialized hardware and system-level access not available in web browsers.

**Q: Can I use this for security auditing?**
A: This is a demonstration tool only. For professional security auditing, use dedicated tools like Wireshark, Kismet, or Aircrack-ng.

**Q: Does this work on mobile devices?**
A: Yes, the interface is fully responsive and optimized for mobile and tablet use.

### Technical Questions

**Q: Why are MAC addresses partially hidden?**
A: For privacy protection. Only the vendor prefix and device suffix are shown.

**Q: How accurate is the signal strength?**
A: Signal values are simulated and include realistic variations. Real measurements would require hardware access.

**Q: Can I integrate this with other tools?**
A: Yes, exported JSON data can be imported into other network analysis tools.

### Usage Questions

**Q: How often should I scan?**
A: Networks are simulated, so each scan will show slight variations in signal strength and timing.

**Q: What's the difference between WPA2 and WPA3?**
A: WPA3 is the latest WiFi security standard with improved encryption and protection against attacks.

**Q: Why do some networks show as "Open"?**
A: Open networks have no password protection and are potentially less secure.
